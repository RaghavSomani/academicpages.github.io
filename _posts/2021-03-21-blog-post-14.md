excerpt: "The [Kadison-Singer problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem){:target="_blank"} arose from the work on quantum mechanics done by [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_dirac){:target="_blank"} in the 1930s. The problem is equivalent to fundamental problems in areas like Operator theory, Hilbert and Banach space theory, Frame theory, Harmonic Analysis, Discrepancy theory, Graph theory, Signal Processing and theoretical Computer Science. The Kadison-Singer problem had been long standing and defied the efforts of most Mathematicians until it was recently solved by [Adam Wade Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Marcus_(mathematician)){:target="_blank"}, [Daniel Alan Spielman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Spielman){:target="_blank"} and [Nikhil Srivastava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil_Srivastava){:target="_blank"} in 2013."

The [Kadison-Singer problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem){:target="_blank"} arose from the work on quantum mechanics done by [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_dirac){:target="_blank"} in the 1930s. The problem is equivalent to fundamental problems in areas like Operator theory, Hilbert and Banach space theory, Frame theory, Harmonic Analysis, Discrepancy theory, Graph theory, Signal Processing and theoretical Computer Science. The Kadison-Singer problem had been long standing and defied the efforts of most Mathematicians until it was recently solved by [Adam Wade Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Marcus_(mathematician)){:target="_blank"}, [Daniel Alan Spielman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Spielman){:target="_blank"} and [Nikhil Srivastava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil_Srivastava){:target="_blank"} for which they were awarded the [George P\'olya Prize in Mathematics](https://evoq-eval.siam.org/prizes-recognition/major-prizes-lectures/detail/george-polya-prize-for-mathematics){:target="_blank"} in 2014, and very recently, the [Michael and Sheila Held Prize](http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/michael-and-sheila-held-prize.html?fbclid=IwAR3C3V9b7UGnSrTNaL55qMKWGQoNx4AN8stkcq3v7gDOms29HeW8_UqslP4){:target="_blank"} in 2021. The proof uses an existence argument which reduces the problem to bounding the roots of the expected characteristic polynomial of certain random matrices employing tools from the theory of random polynomials.
