title: "A note on Conformal Symplectic and Relativistic Optimization"
date: 2020-12-28
permalink: /posts/2020/12/blog-post-13/
excerpt: "This note on a spotlight paper at NeurIPS 2020, has been made while I had been reading the literature on the principle connections between continuous and discrete optimization. The motivation is to understand and create accelerated discrete large scale optimization algorithms from first principles via considering the geometry of phase spaces and numerical integration, specifically symplectic integration. Recent works successfully have been able to throw sufficient light on the two and therefore has attracted my attention."

This note on a spotlight paper at NeurIPS 2020, has been made while I had been reading the literature on the principle connections between continuous and discrete optimization. The motivation is to understand and create accelerated discrete large scale optimization algorithms from first principles via considering the geometry of phase spaces and numerical integration, specifically symplectic integration. Recent works successfully have been able to throw sufficient light on the two and therefore has attracted my attention.
